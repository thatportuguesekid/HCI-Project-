gotta get up I've gotta get goin' I'm gonna see a friend of mine  (He's round and he's fuzzy, I love him because he's just...)  Pooh bear, Winnie the Pooh bear Looking for fun, chasing some honey bees Pooh bear, I know he's out there Rumbly tumbly Climbin' a honey tree  Fun never ends for us, we're so adventurous 'Least every now and again But when you're alone, and there's nobody home It's nice to be able To count on a friend like  Pooh bear, Winnie the Pooh Bear Wherever you go, oh won't you take me please Pooh Bear, I gotta be the-e-ere It's me and it's you My silly old Winnie the Pooooooooooh
